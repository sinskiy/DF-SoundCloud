# Distraction free SoundCloud

*Inspired by [DF Tube](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/df-tube-distraction-free/mjdepdfccjgcndkmemponafgioodelna)*

### ‚ú® Features

- Remove almost every header element, except search and Library
- Redirect you from /feed and /discover to /you/library

### ‚ùì Why

I believe that ***social medias are unnessesary*** in our lifes. I already left most of social medias, but I still listen to music sometimes. There are already distraction-free extensions and Front end minimalistic alternatives for some websites, ***but there are no such thing for SoundCloud***

### üì• Installation

1. Download [crx file](https://github.com/Sinskiy/DF-SoundCloud/releases/latest)

2. Go to window for managing extensions in your browser

    <summary>How?</summary>
    Two ways:

    1. Write `chrome://extensions` in your URL bar

    2. Click on *Extensions* icon in the top right corner, between URL bar and *Hamburger* icon. Then click on `Manage extensions`

    </details>

3. Toggle on `Developer mode` in the top right corner of the window for managing extensions

4. Drag & Drop .crx file that you downloaded

Now extension will work for SoundCloud. Although if you have active windows opened before, you should reload them
